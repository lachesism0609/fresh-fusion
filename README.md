# Fresh Fusion - Full Stack Sushi Restaurant Application

## Project Overview
Fresh Fusion is a comprehensive full-stack web application for a sushi restaurant, featuring a responsive React frontend and robust Node.js backend. The platform enables customers to browse menu items, place orders with real-time stock verification, create accounts, and track order history. The admin interface allows restaurant staff to manage inventory, update menu items, and process orders.
